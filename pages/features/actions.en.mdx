# Actions

When you create an atom, you can define an `actions` object that can be used from any component.

## Understanding actions

<p style={{ color: 'orange' }}>Actions are basically reducers.</p>

When you define an action, you define it with one argument that has 3 properties:

- `state`: The current state when the action is run.
- `dispatch`: The actual function that updates the atom's value.
- `args`: The object that will be passed when the action is used.

> Note: The `useAction` hook returns the object with the actions as reducers

Let's go back to our `clicks` atom.

We will add an action that increases/decreases the clicks count, depending on how it is called

```jsx
import { atom } from 'atomic-state'
export const clicks = atom({
  name: 'clicks-track',
  default: 0,
  actions: {
    update({ args, state, dispatch }) {
      switch (args.type) {
        case 'increase':
          dispatch((c) => c + 1)
          break
        case 'decrease':
          dispatch(() => c - 1)
          break
        default:
          break
      }
    },
  },
})
```

> So `state` and `dispatch` will always be there, the `args` property is what is passed when the action is called from a component/hook

Let's use that action:

```jsx
import { useActions } from 'atomic-state'
import { clicks } from 'atoms'

function Controls() {
  const actions = useActions(clicks)

  const increase = () => actions.update({ type: 'increase' })
  const decrease = () => actions.update({ type: 'decrease' })

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increase}>Increase</button>
      <button onClick={decrease}>Decrease</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

That's it!
