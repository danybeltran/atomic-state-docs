# Additional hooks

There are other useful hooks available. Let's take a look at each of them

## `useValue`

Returns only the atom's value. To use it:

```jsx
import { useValue } from 'atomic-state'
```

Now instead of writing:

```jsx
const [clicksCount] = useAtom(click)
```

You would write:

```jsx
const clicksCount = useValue(click)
```

## `useDispatch`

Returns the function that updates the atom's value. To use it:

```jsx
import { useDispatch } from 'atomic-state'
```

Before:

```jsx
const [, setClicksCount] = useAtom(clicks)
```

After:

```jsx
const setClicksCount = useDispatch(clicks)
```

## `useActions`

Returns the actions object of the atom. To use it:

```jsx
import { useActions } from 'atomic-state'
```

Before:

```jsx
const [clicksCount, setClicksCount, actions] = useAtom(clicks)
```

After:

```jsx
const actions = useActions(clicks)
```
