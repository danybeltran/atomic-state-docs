# Persistence (web)

An atom's value can be saved to the `localStorage` object. This feature only works in the web, so for React Native, you will need to use your own persistence method.

You just need to add the `localStoragePersistence` property when you create the atom.

Its key in `localStorage` will be `"store-" + your_atom_name`.

Let's go back to our `clicks` atom:

```jsx
import { atom } from 'atomic-state'

const clicks = atom({
  name: 'clicks-track',
  default: 0,
  localStoragePersistence: true,
})
```

That atom's value will be saved in the local storage as `store-clicks-track`, so whenever the value changes, localStorage will be updated.

If the page is reloaded, the initial value will be taken from the localStorage (if it was already set).

> Note: Don't use `localStoragePersistence` with atoms which value is a component, this could throw an error
