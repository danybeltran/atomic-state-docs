# Atoms

Atoms are the center of Atomic State.

### What is an atom?

Atoms are the most basic unit of _matter_.

In Atomic State, an atom is a piece of state that will preserve its value across components.
That means that a component can not only be subscribed to it, but also update it, and other
components subscribed will have access to its most updated value.

They can be separated from your components, in different modules, etc.

### Creating an atom

Let's create our first atom that we will use later

In `atoms/index.js`:

```js
import { atom } from 'atomic-state'
export const clicks = atom({
  name: 'clicks-track',
  default: 0,
})
```

> In the code above:<br/>
> `name`: The name of the atom. This is used to track its value and update it across components.<br/>
> `default`: The default atom's value. It can be any data structure (including components)
