# Using an atom

Now we can use the `clicks` atom in any component. To do that, you should use the `useAtom` hook.

This is similar to `useState`, the main difference is that it returns 3 items instead of 2. The third item is the actions object.

But we will see that later :)

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'atomic-state'
import { clicks } from 'atoms'

function App() {
  const [clicksCount, setClicksCount] = useAtom(clicks)
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{clicksCount}</h2>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setClicksCount((c) => c + 1)
        }}
      >
        Increase
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You just created your first atom ðŸ¥³!

## Subscribing to an atom

When you use `useAtom`, that component or custom hook will subscribe to all of the changes made to that atom.

That means, it will trigger a re-render of that component's React tree.

Now, let's split that component into two.

In one component, we will show `clicks` value, and from the other one, we will update it.

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'atomic-state'
import { clicks } from 'atoms'

// Show the value
function ClicksDisplay() {
  const [clicksCount] = useAtom(clicks)
  return <h2>{clicksCount}</h2>
}

// We will update `clicks` here
function ClicksUpdate() {
  // Ommit `clicks`'s value, we don't need it
  const [, setClicksCount] = useAtom(clicks)
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setClicksCount((c) => c + 1)
      }}
    >
      Increase
    </button>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ClicksDisplay />
      <ClicksUpdate />
    </div>
  )
}
```

That's it!

Basically, all components subscribed to `clicks` will re-render:)

Isn't it amazing?

Now imagine having to write:

```jsx
const [clicksCount, setClicksCount] = useAtom(clicks)
```

Whenever you want to use an atom. We'll see an alternative in the <a href="/features/additional-hooks">Additional hooks</a> chapter.
